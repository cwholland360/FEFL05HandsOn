 Introduction to Flexbox

Requirements
Give your page the following:
Header
At least ten (10) images
Use Flexbox to center and evenly space your images accross the page.
If your images are large and don't all fit in one row on the page, they should wrap down to another row so in the end, it looks like a grid of pictures.
Style your page to your liking
